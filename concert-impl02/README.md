First version of the Concert implementation. For now RENS, FP and LocalBranching heuristics
are working fine. For this implementation the MIP was configured to run with a limited time
and the results are being compared with the heuristics results. For 71% instances (10 to 25 cities)  RENS+LocalBranching found better results than CPLEX.

The results.xlsx shows the collected data.
